Bear with me for two paragraphs, I think that you need a question to give any answer, and you need to convey what it really means, words can be tricky. Why did I came to ask "What is the right thing to do?".

I am a curious human who loves to know "why". This part of me grew stronger over the years, and led to a lot of problems with choosing how I should behave. With science and our modern understanding of the world - "good" and "bad" quickly lost their practicality. For example, being kind and honest made me satisfied, but it didn't mean that people who were actively hurting others fared badly at the same time. That lead to thinking - ok, feelings are not really a good measure of how things work. So how do they? That was even worse, because no approach seemed to be true. It didn't even work 90% of the time, any philosophy or religion looped upon itself at some point.

This generated a huge split inside of me for purely logical reason: are we just deceiving each other? Without some factual basis for our actions, everything is just a game of poker. We are all bluffing, and the one who is the best at it makes others do his bidding, but it will fail at some point anyway. We are all just struggling, and then die. Not fun for me at all. And no, nihilism also doesn't work, it is just another bluff.

Okay, now the answer. First, a foundation. We began as life, and evolved to be humans. In essence we need to thrive, sustain ourselves and hopefully reproduce. This is embedded our nature. At some point to be better at that, through evolution, any organism gains intelligence, a game changer. You start to gain more and more cognitive functions, and at some point, you enter the world of consciousness. You are aware of your internal state. This leads to an observation - consciousness (some may call it spirit/soul) comes after intelligence (mind), and both are preceded by some kind of organism (body). Each affect one another as they come together, but they are not the same (emergence).

This is super important, as your mind may play tricks on your consciousness, and vice versa. "I hate him" is really an observation of a thought that mind had produced as a response to an emotion. And emotion is a stimulus from the body. This loop of feeling, thinking about it and noticing becomes your experience. Experience is also a potential stimulus for you, from which more thoughts can stem. This is the catch, because experience is no longer something real, you created it. It is abstract. This is where all of our bluffs start, and how culture came to be. We started playing a game of poker, because we started developing a sequence of illusions. But they will always have holes in reasoning - they are not reality and cannot fully express it.

If you learn to regulate your mind, you can change how you engage with the world. This is the basis of mindfulness, and it works - I feel angry, but I am not angry. A huge difference. Why? You effectively observed that you are more than just your bodily functions, than your experience. At that moment, you expand as something more than just a body (again, emergence). You can see reality as it is, and use your experience as a tool, a heuristic, but not the truth. No matter if this is also represented as some reaction in your brain, the observer is the observed after all. We don't want to split from our nature and enter a voodo land, just see what it really is and grow beyond it.

Be in touch with reality, while you live - live. You only have this moment, both your past and future are just a thought - a visage. Everything happens in the now. That is the essence. Use your tools to make the most out of it - follow your desires, construct goals, enjoy what you have, create new things to support that. And if you get lost, see if what you experience is true or was created by your thought. Then you will see the nonsense of it. After you become aware, out of that moment, a correct action will arise. Doing things this way is hard because how we, as a humanity got conditioned. We think too much, and once you experience the state of awareness, it is easy to convert it into a thought too. I need to feel this way, I have to do it, this is how it should be. With expectations, you are back to square one, you try to recreate world with thoughts, and as we stated, thoughts are not the reality. You need to be able to come to a halt with your thoughts, use them only to solve problems without attachment, and then let them go.

If you will be able to use all of your parts for what they are made for - body for doing, mind for solving, and consciousness for interactions (relations), you will naturally **do the right thing**. Kindness, love, honesty, compassion, empathy - all are just expressions of freedom that comes out of not being bound by illusions about the world. Hate, jelousy, anger, greed - all are just a result of becoming a slave to your own mind. That's what I observed and how I approach my life. I find it heavily practical and hope that you will find it useful too.

Please do write to me if you have any questions or comments. This is probably the most important thing in my life, and I would love to discuss it with you!

**Sidenote**: You can probably find a lot of counterarguments to what I have written. I also do. And I started to catch when this is a construct of my thoughts too, especially when discussing gray areas. Here is an example - what if somebody wants to kill me? How can I be compassionate and kind to him? But you see, if you remove mind from that, defending yourself is something totally natural to do. Trying to make it right or wrong is a construct of your mind itself. You can be kind and compassionate to him, but you don't need to be a punching bag. If you could approach this situation fully with a clear mind, any result that sprouts from it should be the right one - even if it would result in someobdy losing their life. Situations like that are really hard, and we don't have any tools to ensure that we will be able to have will strong enough to ensure our ideal. So we still should have things like society, laws and rules. It's just that they are imperfect. But you see - there is hope we can do better, and there is a compass to come to an understanding that doesn't require any authority or being right or wrong.
