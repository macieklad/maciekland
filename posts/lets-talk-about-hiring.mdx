There is work to be done, and we don't have enough hands on deck. You have the hands, and they are free at the moment.
**Let's talk**. Experience is irrelevant. What matters is whether you can do the work and how well you can do it.

That would be it in most cases, but life isn't about most cases. There are exceptions. Can we make an exception for you?
**Let's talk**. By teaching, we can learn too, so maybe there is already a place for exceptions? Just show us that you are one.

I want to work with you. What you do, interests me, and I want to invest my time to build something together. But together
implies that I too have something to say, and that we both have something to offer. **Let's talk**. I want to know what you have to offer.

This is how we do things here and how we got there. By working with us, you get this, and can learn that. Anything unclear? **Let's talk**. Interested? **Let's work**.

This is who I am, here you can read why I decided to work with you, and here is what I already did and what I am able to do. Anything unclear? **Let's talk**. Interested? **Let's work**.

Be transparent, be honest, be open, be vulnerable, be human. Hiring can get complicated, but most of the time, it doesn't need to. **Let's talk. Let's work**.

P.S. How to talk, and maybe not too much? How to scale the talking? How to make sure that it's going to work? **Let's talk :)**
