## You need some CI, but not too much

When you start a project, especially alone, you do not need to configure CI for automated tests, deployments, you name it. What you want is to keep boring things away - clicking or writing the same thing time and time again. Unless the availability of your application is impacting your business or progress, you can go far without any CI. In most cases, speed of iteration by doing things by hand will make up for the lack of automation.

Hosting services have a lot of built-in goodies to speed up deployments and tests. But I always struggled with tools for abstracting the documentation away - namely, tagging and documenting changes, as there are multiple solutions for each language.

So this article will show you how to set up a simple CI pipeline that will automatically tag your releases and generate release notes, no matter the language you are using. As a bonus, we will also make the process composable - you will be able to trigger other workflows after your release is done. And you will be able to do so manually (maybe you will want to rollback a version), or automatically under certain conditions, to not spam your Github Actions with unnecessary runs.

Basically, a perfect release flow for a small project.

## Action for automatic releases

You will need a single action to do all the work. Most of the tasks can be done using API calls, simplified by the `github-script` action, use them if you want, I prefer to use already available ones, even if they are really simple (mainly because I am lazy, but there are other reasons, duh). The action will:

- Generate a changelog based from the commits since the last tag
- Commit the generated changelog to the repository (this will not trigger another run)
- Create a new tag from the commits
- Create a new release by using the generated tag and changelog ouput.

To keep everything similar, commits that affect the changelog will follow the [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) spec(commit types can be changed). Versioning is semver based. I will explain each step directly in the code.

```yaml
name: Create new application release

# We want releases to trigger on pushes to main, and also on manual dispatch,
# so we can trigger a release manually, mainly for testing or rollbacks.
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      deployed-tag:
        description: "Deployed tag"
        required: false
        default: ""

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # By default, github jobs GITHUB_TOKEN does not have write access
    # to the repository, nor can it call other actions through the API.
    # We need to elevate the permissions to create CHANGELOG changes
    # in the repository, create tags and call other actions.
    permissions:
      contents: write
      actions: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code

      # Based on the last tag and commits since main branch
      # (change the branch as needed), this action will determine
      # the next semver version. If there are no commits since
      # the last tag, it will warn (by default it fails)
      # and not create a new tag.

Nice and easy, and without language specific packages. I hope you will find it useful.

## Bonus: deployment actions

Some may be interested how the deployment action looks like as I like to keep it controllable. So here it is, I mainly write deployment actions when using `fly.io`,
other platforms that I use have automatic deployments anyways. In the action you can see that both development and production deployments can be done using the same action,
I just set a variable that points to a different config file based on the environment.

```yaml
name: Deploy application to fly.io

on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      ref:
        description: "The branch or tag to deploy"
        required: true
        default: "main"
      config:
        description: "Environment to deploy to"
        required: true
        options: ["production", "development"]
        default: "production"

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
        with:
          ref: ${{ inputs.ref }}

      - name: Setup flyctl
        uses: superfly/flyctl-actions/setup-flyctl@master
        with:
          version: 0.0.475

      - name: Set deployed config file
        id: deployed-config
        run: |
          if [ "${{ inputs.config }}" == "production" ]; then
              echo "file=fly.toml" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          else
              echo "file=fly.dev.toml" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT
          fi

      - name: Deploy application
        run: flyctl deploy --config ${{ steps.deployed-config.outputs.file }}
        env:
          FLY_API_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLY_API_TOKEN }}

      - name: Add action summary
        run: |
          echo "🚀 Deployed ${{ inputs.ref }} to ${{ inputs.config }}" >> $GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY
```
