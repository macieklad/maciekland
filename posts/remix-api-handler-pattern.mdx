export const description = `Remix can serve the niche role of being a backend framework. If you are accustomed to existing backend frameworks, you might want to associate HTTP verbs with single functions, instead of having only "loaders" and "actions". Let's implement that.`;
export const publishedAt = new Date("2023-04-21T00:00:00.000Z");

You will need a single utility helper. It will still use Remix loaders and actions underneath, but they will be built from a handler configuration object. If a method is not supported, a response with `405` status code will be thrown, as expected.

```ts
import { ActionFunction, LoaderFunction } from "@remix-run/server-runtime";

interface HandlerArgs {
  get?: LoaderFunction;
  post?: ActionFunction;
  put?: ActionFunction;
  delete?: ActionFunction;
  patch?: ActionFunction;
}

export function handler({ get, post, put, delete: del, patch }: HandlerArgs) {
  const loader: LoaderFunction = (...args) =>
    get?.(...args) ?? new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });

  const action: LoaderFunction = (...args) => {
    const callbacks: Record<string, LoaderFunction | undefined> = {
      POST: post,
      PUT: put,
      DELETE: del,
      PATCH: patch,
    };

    if (!callbacks[args[0].request.method]) {
      return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
    }

    return callbacks[args[0].request.method]?.(...args);
  };

  return {
    loader,
    action,
  };
}
```

With this, inside your route you can use this utility like this:

```tsx
import { handler } from "~/utils/api";

// If you only use get verb, you can only export the loader.
export const { loader, action } = handler({
  get: async () => {
    return new Response("Your data");
  },
  post: () => {
    return new Response("Action executed");
  },
});
```

Thanks to this pattern we can have some nicely looking API routes, without modyfing the way Remix works. What I like about this approach and Remix in general, especially when using node, is that it acts as an adapter, in loaders and actions you are always getting a standard fetch API compliant objects, e.g. `Request` and `Response`, instead of brittle `IncomingMessage` or `ServerResponse`. If needed, you can swap your http server (express, fastify), server runtime (node, bun, deno) or even the whole framework (remix, next), extract the logic, and the code will mostly work.
