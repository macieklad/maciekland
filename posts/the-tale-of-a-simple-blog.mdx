## Yet another blog

I feel that every person has a huge pool of things he or she can talk or write
about. We experience life, with our own twists and turns. After discovering
something neat, we rarely share it. It is 2022, and it is well known -
[learning in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public/) is the way to go. For
myself, writing gives me time to ponder, clears up my thinking, makes me more
precise and calm. There is also this feeling of completeness when you sum up a
topic and polish what you know. This got me to work.

## Working it out

The initial goal of keeping things simple was pragmatic - I did not have much
success with starting a personal website in the past, so making it mostly
effortless prognosed some chance of success. I wanted to start with next or
remix, but the classic `npm install` got me thinking - how basic could the tech
stack really be for a blog? (by the way, this brought back
[a memory of a wonderful talk by Ryan Dahl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3NR9Spj0DmQ))

And I did not answer that, as you may guess. Time went by, I started diving deep
and got irritated, the editor was left empty. But what was left was a really fun
question - how do I deem a stack simple? Or event better, going straight
downhill, how to define "simple" in the context of programming (I know, this may
have already been too philosophical).

I probably could rant a long time about calling something "simple". Even more so
when I'm currently going through "The Mythical Man Month". And you as a reader
probably do not want to make this an hour-long read. So stopping myself right in
the tracks again, it went like this - I searched for an answer far and wide,
considered multiple options, read far too many resources, until finally stopping
to do the right thing as I should have from the start - to define the game I
wanted to play, its rules, and a strategy to execute.

The first part was mostly done, I wanted to start writing as soon as possible.
What lingered was the yearning for it to really be mine. I did not let that go
away, so the final goal was to develop a personalised blog/personal website as
fast as possible.

This gave me a sense of direction and context that created the requirements for
the project:

- If the blog was going to be personalized, I wanted to have full control over
  it. So no SSG/SSR/ISG shenanigans, just give me my request and I will take
  care of the response without over-engineering the whole thing.
- I will use it mainly for writing, so the process should have fast feedback
  loop, be effortless and extensible. If I have an unusual idea, I want to be
  able to visualize it as I see fit, deploy it in a minute, then reproduce the
  process later with a line or two of code.

## Doing the real work

Using my own guidelines the stack emerged by itself. I have chosen deno as a
runtime, deno deploy as the deployment target, react as the templating engine
(no client side code though, just rendering on the server), pure css for
styling, and mdx with plugins to write articles quickly.

With deno, I did not have to set up typescript myself or through frameworks, the
standard library removed the need for most external libraries, linter and other
goodies were built in.

Deno is a clear upgrade over node, the only thing stopping it being not so rich
ecosystem. I did not have to learn any new frameworks, the project logic was
written in a whooping 3 files, when I have to change some styles, I simply open
`styles.css` and change what I have to. React gives templating goodies, and does
not introduce any bundle size or magic as it is simply used for rendering html.
Mdx is a clear upgrade over writing html, is infinitely tweakable with plugins
and I can migrate my content to other system whenever I want.

It took a day to glue everything together. I encountered some issues while
working with mdx and rendering react on the server but that was basically it. I
won't deny that the task would be much harder if I was just starting my
programming journey - when you work with raw requests and responses, knowing a
thing or two about things like cache headers is invaluable and there is a lot of
thinking about details. This is not pleasurable when you do not know what really
happens. Modern frameworks abstract away that complexity, but this is exactly
what made the stack worthwhile for me. I had an occasion to see the state of
modern web APIs, to refresh my knowledge and see what can be achieved without
additional abstractions. There is no build step and deployment takes ten seconds
at most. If I have to add something like analytics I will add it to the request
flow.

Of course there were concerns too. For example, raw pixel values fly left and
right in the css for the time being, there is no consistency there, also, I may
have used next and have mdx configured right away and the list goes on. But
should I care about it right now? Nah.

## Getting things straight

I will say what most of us probably want to hear from time to time. Don't
bullshit yourself and see things as they are. Does the solution solve the
problem? Yes. Will you have issues with maintaining it? I certainly won't, year
later I will just read the code and catch up, there is no hidden magic. Nobody
else will work with me on it, so I don't have to care about that too.

So it is really simple, you may ask? Can you do what has to be done without
pulling your hair out? Yes? Great! Does changing it introduce obstacles that
will hinder development in the future? No? Wonderful. Is it quickly deployable?
Probably? [Good enough.](https://www.swyx.io/good-enough) You probably have
something simple on your hands, all things considered.

This blog fulfils the criteria, so let me consider it simple. It came to be
without much time but with a lot of care. Hopefully it will serve its purpose
well.

## P.S. It really can be simple

The main code serving this website is shown below. External utils and components
do not exceed 100 lines, and are mostly static html or some glue code for
existing libraries. Taking in mind that there is no framework underneath, it is
pretty crazy how much can be done in a modern way with the standard libraries
and a bit of code.

If you are curious, the complete code is available
[publicly on github.](https://github.com/macieklad/maciekland)
